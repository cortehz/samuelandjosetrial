      <p id="tribute-info">
        A tribute to our Favourite Manchester United Player, Chicharito:
        Hernández was born in Guadalajara, Jalisco and first played in a recreation league when he was seven years old.
        Hernández lived in Morelia, Michoacán for over four years while his father, footballer Javier "Chícharo"
        Hernández, played for Monarcas Morelia.[5] While living in Morelia, Hernández attended elementary school at the
        Instituto Piaget where he studied from third to sixth grade and played for the school's football team.[5]

        At the age of nine, Hernández joined C.D. Guadalajara and signed his first professional contract when he was
        15.[6] He was set to play in the 2005 FIFA U-17 World Championship, but an injury sidelined him from the team
        that ultimately won the championship.[7] Whilst playing football professionally, Hernández was also taking
        business administration classes at Universidad del Valle de Atemajac.[6] Hernández has held both Hugo Sánchez
        and Rafael Márquez as his football idols growing up.
